Tasks:

Consider the uncountable graph function:
An example of an uncountable graph is the simple graph G1 = (V (G1), E(G1))
where V (G1) = R and {x, y} ∈ E(G1) if and only if |x − y| = 1. Notice that this
is a 2-regular graph. A related example is Gq = (V (Gq), E(Gq)) where V (Gq) = R
and {x, y} ∈ E(Gq) if and only if x − y ∈ Q \ {0}. In this case, each vertex is
(countably) infinite in degree.


1. create a graph class object
2. write a function to count the vertex set 
3. write a function to count the edge set
4. Write a function to count the degree of a vertex
5. Create a Python function visualize_infinite_grid(start, steps) that prints the first steps number of nodes of an infinite grid starting from a node in a 2D coordinate system
